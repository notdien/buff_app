# For Practice
### I created this app to practice full-stack development, everything here is a first-time kind of thing and I had no expectation going in. I just wanted to create something so I can practice and learn how to put a full-stack together.

# Summary and challenges

### The frontend was created using React, I had no prior experience to using React before this project so the React frontend was by far the most difficult aspect of this project, there were so many different concepts to learn and understand. I only briefly used Axios before so I spent a lot of time googling and reading to understand really what I was doing.
### I also learned, I am not a very good UI designer and I am extremely bad at User experience so this is something I will definitely be practing more on.

### The Backend Routing was created using Flask/Quart - I initially started off with Flask but later discovered that Flask did not support Async functions so I switched over to Quart to allow that. Creating routes with Python was significantly easier than ExpressJS but I think in the future I prefer to develop more in ExpressJS than in Python.
### I also enjoyed the backend development process more than the frontend, but only time will tell.
### For the backend, I also added simple error-catching so I had a easier time debugging when I needed to.

### The database used was MongoDB. MongoDB was the first step I started with and had the most issues with mostly because of my lack of knowledge on using Motor, but besides that the Database part was a good experience.

### Also I would like to add as a side note, I learned a lot about Python's virtual env after this project. I know now that it is better to use virtual env to avoid clashing with different versions of the modules and different versions of Python. I learned how to pip freeze and set up different virtual env on different computers as well in this process.

## Summary - I learned how to connect and put together a full-stack project using Quart, React and MongoDB. This is was Summer personal project that I wanted to put together just to learn - towards the end of the Summer, I had to time crunch a lot of things due to homework/assignments/test and Fall semester starting again so a couple features were cut however I plan to come back to re-create the frontend aspect because I am not totally happy with it.

# This is Version 1, I plan to redo the project, specifically the frontend in the future.
